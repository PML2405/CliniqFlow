# **Incremental Development Plan for CliniqFlow**

This document outlines a detailed plan for developing the CliniqFlow application using an incremental SDLC model. The project is divided into four distinct increments, each delivering a functional and testable subset of the total features. This approach allows for early user feedback, better risk management, and a phased rollout of the application.

## **Summary of Increments**

| Increment | Title | Key Modules & Features | Primary Goal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | Core Patient Foundation | Patient Profile Creation, Patient Directory, View/Edit Profiles, Offline Storage Setup | Establish a reliable, digital patient records database and validate data entry workflows. |
| **2** | Scheduling & Daily Workflow | Appointment Calendar, Appointment Management (Create, Reschedule, Cancel), Dashboard View | Digitize the clinic's daily scheduling process and provide staff with an at-a-glance view of operations. |
| **3** | Clinical Visit Management | Case Sheet Creation, Clinical Data Entry, File Attachments (X-rays, photos), Digital Consent | Replace paper-based visit notes with a comprehensive digital Case Sheet for doctors. |
| **4** | Prescription & Finalization | Prescription Generation, Security Hardening, UI/UX Polish, User Documentation | Complete all core features, refine the application based on feedback, and prepare for final deployment. |

## **Increment 1: Core Patient Foundation**

**Objective:** The primary goal of this increment is to build the foundational patient management system. This is the highest priority as all other modules depend on a robust patient database. It also addresses the technical risk of implementing the database and offline data persistence early in the project.

**Modules & Features to Implement (from SRS):**

* **Patient Profile (Patient\_Profile):**  
  * Personal\_Info: Name, UID, Registration Date, DOB, Age, Sex.  
  * Contact\_Info: Address, Occupation, Email, Phone Numbers.  
  * Emergency\_Contact: Name, Relation, Phone Numbers.  
  * Medical\_History: Referred By, General History, Allergies, Medications, Habits.  
* **Patient Directory:** A searchable and scrollable list view that displays a Patient\_Profile\_Summary (Name, UID, Phone Number) for all patients.  
* **CRUD Functionality:** Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for all patient records.

**Technical Goals:**

* Design and implement the database schema for all patient-related data structures.  
* Build the user interface (UI) forms for creating and editing patient profiles.  
* Develop the core application logic for saving, retrieving, and updating patient data.  
* Implement and test the initial offline storage mechanism, ensuring that patient data can be accessed and modified without an active internet connection.

**Testing & Validation:**

* Verify that new patients can be added with all required fields from the SRS.  
* Confirm that the patient directory displays an accurate summary and can be searched effectively.  
* Test the process of viewing a full profile and saving edits.  
* Perform initial offline testing: create a patient, go offline, and verify the data is still accessible.

**Stakeholder Feedback Focus:**

* Is the data entry process for new patients intuitive and efficient for clinic staff?  
* Are all the necessary fields from their existing paper records captured in the new digital forms?  
* Is the patient directory easy to navigate and search?

## **Increment 2: Scheduling & Daily Workflow**

**Objective:** Building upon the patient foundation, this increment introduces appointment management and the main dashboard. This will provide immediate value by digitizing the clinic's daily operational workflow.

**Modules & Features to Implement (from SRS):**

* **Appointment Management (Appointment):**  
  * Create new appointments linked to a Patient\_UID from the directory.  
  * Include fields for Date, Time, Duration, and Purpose.  
  * Implement functionality to reschedule and cancel existing appointments.  
* **Appointment Calendar:** A visual, interactive calendar interface to view daily, weekly, and monthly schedules.  
* **Dashboard:** The main landing screen of the app, showing key information like the current/next appointment and a summary of today's schedule.

**Technical Goals:**

* Develop the calendar UI component and integrate it with the appointment data.  
* Implement the backend logic for scheduling, including basic conflict checks.  
* Create the dashboard UI, which will query and display appointment data for the current day.  
* Ensure that appointment data is also stored for offline access.

**Testing & Validation:**

* Test the complete lifecycle of an appointment: creation, viewing on the calendar, rescheduling, and cancellation.  
* Verify that the dashboard accurately reflects the day's schedule in real-time.  
* Ensure that a user cannot create a conflicting appointment in the same time slot.

**Stakeholder Feedback Focus:**

* Is the calendar view clear and easy to understand?  
* Is the process of booking a new appointment for an existing patient quick and simple?  
* Does the dashboard provide the most critical information needed at the start of the day?

## **Increment 3: Clinical Visit Management**

**Objective:** To deliver the core clinical functionality of the application. This increment focuses on the digital Case Sheet, which allows doctors to document patient visits.

**Modules & Features to Implement (from SRS):**

* **Case Sheet (Case\_Sheet):**  
  * Create a new, dated case sheet linked to a Patient\_UID and their scheduled appointment.  
  * Fields for Dr\_Incharge, Chief\_Complaint, Provisional\_Diagnosis, and Treatment\_Plan.  
  * A mechanism to record patient Consent.  
* **File Attachments (Attachment):** The ability to upload and attach files (e.g., PDFs, X-rays, images) to a specific Case Sheet.

**Technical Goals:**

* Build the UI for creating and viewing detailed case sheets.  
* Implement the file upload functionality, including handling storage and linking file references to the correct case sheet in the database.  
* Develop a simple digital consent feature, such as a checkbox or a signature capture field.  
* Extend the offline capabilities to include case sheets and their attachments.

**Testing & Validation:**

* Verify that a doctor can create a complete case sheet for a patient's visit.  
* Test the file attachment feature: upload a file, close the app, reopen, and ensure the file can be retrieved.  
* Confirm that consent is properly recorded and saved.

**Stakeholder Feedback Focus:**

* Is the case sheet workflow logical and efficient for a doctor during a patient consultation?  
* Are all essential clinical fields included? Are there any missing?  
* Is the process of attaching and viewing files intuitive?

## **Increment 4: Prescription & Finalization**

**Objective:** The final increment completes the application's feature set, incorporates user feedback from previous stages, and prepares the product for full deployment.

**Modules & Features to Implement (from SRS):**

* **Prescription Management (Prescription\_Item):**  
  * Functionality to add multiple drugs to a prescription, with fields for Drug\_Name, Dosage, Frequency, and Duration.  
  * Generate a formatted prescription that can be printed or shared digitally.  
* **Non-Functional Requirements:**  
  * **Security:** Conduct a final security review, hardening database access rules and securing endpoints.  
  * **UI/UX Polish:** Refine the entire application's UI based on cumulative feedback, ensuring a consistent and professional look and feel.  
  * **User Documentation:** Create a user manual and/or in-app help guides to assist staff in using the application.

**Technical Goals:**

* Implement the prescription generation logic and UI.  
* Perform a comprehensive code review and security audit.  
* Refactor and optimize code for performance, especially database queries and offline sync.  
* Finalize all user-facing text and documentation.

**Testing & Validation:**

* Perform complete, end-to-end testing of all user workflows (from adding a new patient to creating their prescription).  
* Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with the entire clinic staff to get final sign-off.  
* Test performance under load and on various target mobile devices.

**Stakeholder Feedback Focus:**

* Does the application meet all the requirements specified in the SRS document?  
* Is the final product stable, secure, and ready for daily use in the clinic?  
* Is the documentation clear and helpful?
