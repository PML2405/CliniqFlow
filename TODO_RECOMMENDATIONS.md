# CliniqFlow Increment 1 Follow-up Actions

## Immediate
- **[Restart Flutter app]**: Stop any running `flutter run` session and launch again so the client reconnects to Firestore with the newly deployed development rules.
- **[Record dev rules usage]**: `firestore.rules` currently allows unrestricted access. Track that this is temporary and should never ship to production.

## Short Term
- **[Design secure Firestore rules]**: Replace `allow read, write: if true;` in `firestore.rules` with authentication-aware logic (for example, require `request.auth != null` and validate document structure for the `patients` collection).
- **[Add authentication flow]**: Update the Flutter app (see `lib/features/patients/data/patient_repository.dart` and associated UI) to sign users in before accessing Firestore, so the secure rules can rely on `request.auth`.
- **[Document setup steps]**: Capture the Firebase project ID (`cliniqflow-cd4a7`), Firestore region (`asia-south1`), and deployment commands (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`) in onboarding docs.

## Long Term
- **[Review security & privacy]**: As Increment 4 approaches, audit Firestore indexes, offline persistence, and access control to ensure compliance with clinic data regulations.
- **[Automate checks]**: Consider adding CI steps (e.g., `flutter analyze`, `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --dry-run`) and integration tests covering the patient CRUD workflow.

## Increment 2 â€“ Scheduling Follow-ups
- **[Hook up status filter UI]**: Expose the new `AppointmentScheduleController.setStatusFilter()` capability in `appointment_schedule_page.dart` so users can view scheduled/completed/canceled subsets.
- **[Extend controller tests]**: Add coverage for `nextFilteredAppointment`, cancellation pathways, and conflict detection to solidify the TDD baseline.
- **[Add widget tests]**: Introduce widget-level tests for `_DailySummary` and `_ScheduleSliver` to ensure Material 3 UI reacts correctly to controller state.
- **[Enhance filtering UX]**: Provide quick chips or segmented controls for common filters to reduce taps on mobile.
- **[Persist filter selection]**: Consider storing `statusFilter` in `SharedPreferences` so clinicians resume the same view next launch.
